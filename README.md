# Introduction
Welcome to qBraid micro-grants repository. We are so glad that you are here and are considering applying for the grants! The field of quantum computing holds a lot of promises. In order to realize them, immense effort is required in various aspects of the field. Quantum software is going to be one of the crucial aspects that needs more innovation; the purpose of these grants is to provide impetus to new ideas and give them the required push to realize them. We are providing one technical grant and five grants for creating new content in quantum computing. 
# Deadlines
Submission: 12am EST, 15 November, 2021.
Prizes announcement: 15 December 2021. 

# Open source technical projects
 Do you have an exciting idea for a quantum software? Do you want to...
 - simulate a large molecule on a quantum computer?
 - build the best quantum machine learning model?
 - optimize your portfolio using quantum optimization?
 - build quantum version of classical games?
 
Then this grant is for you. Write up a 2-3 page proposal that clearly lays down the goal of the project, along with the execution strategy. Make sure to include the following
- an abstract
- background and project description
- your strategy for execution and timeline.

# Open source content
Do you think you can explain the mind-twisting concepts of quantum computing in a way that is better than everyone? Then this challenge is for you! You are free to submit an entry for your favorite topic in the field of quantum computing. Some of the suggestions are:
Broad:
- quantum machine learning
- quantum finance
- quantum error correction
- quantum simulation
- variational algorithms
- quantum games
Focused:
- quantum circuits
- entanglement
- quantum teleporation
- measurement
- Shor's code

or anything related to quantum computing that we didn't cover in the list above.


# Rules and guidelines for projects and content:
- The project and quantum content should be an original creation. 
- For technical projects you are free to use any quantum-SDK of your choice, but we encourage you to use the (qBraid platform)[https://qbraid.com/], primarily, for your development. The qBraid-team will be happy to answer any questions you may have regardin the platform. 
- The participants must be US or Canadian citizens (We are exploring how this could relaxed, stay tuned!).

# Finding people to join your team:
You can apply for the micro-grants alone or with a team. If you'd like to find team members to join your team, please make sure to tag it with the label `looking for teammates` feel free to open a new issue on this repository with the title of your project and a little summary, so people can comment/join your team.  Please be respectful when you are sharing info about your project, we want everyone in our community to feel safe and respected!
